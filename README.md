Interactive Media Group 13 Assessment Workplace 
The overall idea is to have 3D map of building 11 In, which for each of the doors will be shown on the map. There will be arrows pointed at each door to signify at you can click on them. Songs will play at each door once clicked on. The amplitude of the songs will be based on the people counter. There will be an animation of the sun throughout the day based on solar radiation. The background color will notify the temperature of the day. 

Graphical elements: 3D animation, rotation animation of the building, rising and setting suns for solar radiation, color changes based on people counter, opening and closing door when clicked on, number of people will be represented by the people coming in and out 

Interaction elements: 

Slidebar for time throughout the day 

Dropdown list 

Dials for the volume 

Data required: People counter, temperature and solar radiation 

People counter is at the different doors and amplitude of the songs at each door will depend on the number of people. Temperature is for background, and the song will define the temperature (hotter = African music, colder = Christmas music). Solar radiation is just for the sun 

3D animation: Ethan & Lucie. Sonification: Tu. Solar radiation: Dennie 

GitHub for team animation and individual animation 

We can ask the students at UTS to test the system once itâ€™s completed 

Explorability and sense-making: Have arrows pointed at each door to let the users know that they can interact with doors.
